globalInventoryData

<Line 8> <Bad naming> <Does not follow naming convention of classes>
<Line 16> <Unrelated method> <Violation of SRP. Global Inventory Data should store data, not calculate something>
<Line 9-13> <Static variables, No encapsulation> <Global variables must be avoided as much as possible>
<Line 12-13> <Initialized values which are not constants>

inventoryManagementSystem

<Line 6> <Bad naming> <Does not follow proper naming convention>

reportScheduler

Entire class. Bad naming convention, static method, unused class.

Warehouse

<Line 4-6> <No encapsulation> <Attributes are public>
<Line 4, Line 8> <Bad naming> <The id of what? What is i?>
<Line 9-11> <Inconsistent attribute assignment> <Two attributes use 'this' keyword, but one doesn't. Creates an inconsistency visually>

AppTest

Entire code is filled with comments.
The test codes have very inconsistent and unclear names. 
The test codes themselves do not make it clear what is being tested.
For some reason, it extends another class which is absolutely unnecessary and serves no purpose other than to create a visually displeasing situation.
Line 26 has a static method.
The only one test case actually present is not even a proper test case.

inventorySystem

<Line 6> <Bad Naming> <Class name doesn't follow proper naming convention>
<Line 7> <Attribute assignment> <The attribute is not a constant>
<Line 10-21> <Class inside a class>
<Line 11> <Bad Naming> <Doesn't specify whose 'id' it is>
<Line 11-19> <No encapsulation> <All attributes are public>
<Line 23-37> <Long class> <Class inside a class>
<Line 24-29> <No encapsulation>
<Line 33-35> <No encapsulation>
<Line 41-67> <Conditional complexity, nested if statements, magic numbers, feature envy> <Very difficult to read something with so many if statetments. On top of that, it is not clear why '0' is a threshold for price and stock. It is a magic number. Properties of 'warehouse' is being accessed via product>
<Line 74-99> <Switch cases, Magic numbers> <Convoluted lines of code with unclear switch cases and magic numbers>
<Line 106,107,114,115,116,124,125,126> <Message chaining>
<Line 132> <Long Function>
<Line 140> <Message chaining>
<Line 143-155> <Conditional Complexity>
The entire class is a long class, which would be split into multiple classes to carry out different functionalities
